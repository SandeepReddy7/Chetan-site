				<h1>MOBILE DEVELOPMENT</h1>
				<p>The MOBILE experience has become a part of our daily life. With a well-defined map of mobile idea at hand, we will get down to a detailed elaboration of your project.
					Weâ€™ll providing you with regular updates on milestones and the risk and cost management process.We develop the apps to the platforms like Symbian, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and ios to cover the most widely used smartphones</p>
				<p>Mobile application development is similar to Web application 
				development and has its roots in more traditional software development.
				One critical difference, however, is that mobile applications (apps)
				are often written specifically to take advantage of the unique features
				a particular mobile device offers. For instance, a gaming app might be 
				written to take advantage of the android,iPhone's accelerometer.</p>
				<p>In the future, it's expected that a majority of mobile application 
				development efforts will focus on creating browser-based applications 
				that are device-agnostic. Browser-based applications are simply websites 
				that are built for mobile browsers. Such sites are built to load quickly
				over a cellular network and have finger-friendly navigation. </p>
